# 4-ball-challenge-OOP
This is a 4 ball challenge where we can learn Processing and Oops Concepts.
In this challenge,I created two classes.
The class MySketch.java and MySketchOop.java
Run MySketch.java for Procedural Approach which Solves the 4-Ball-Challenge Without Oops Concepts.
Run MySketchOop.java for Object-Oriented Approach which Solves 4-Ball-Challenge with the Help of Oops Concepts.
This 4-Ball-Challenge Helps me to Learn and Understand Processing and Oops.
